In this way you are sure that each course is inserted exactly three times. There is the little drawback that you might insert professor Simonelli randomly on a slot already assigned to Coletti (this is, by the way, exactly what happens in real life) and the lesson which was already there is overwritten, so sometimes the number of slots might be less than 3.
