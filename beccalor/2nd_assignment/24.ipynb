    "Branch and bound is a heuristic technique for maximisation problems which does not improve the worst case complexity but only the average case. Its strategy is to branch the problem into sub problems, each with a bound on the maximisation function, and exploring the sub problem which is more promising. This sub problem is then branched again into sub sub problems, each with a bound, and so on until we may not go on anymore and a solution is found. If the solution’s utility is largest than the bound on every open sub problem, then it is also the maximum; otherwise the appropriate branches are examined until a better solution is found or until no branch with a bound higher than the current best solution exists."
