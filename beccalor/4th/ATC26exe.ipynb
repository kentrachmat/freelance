This is because in this case we want to know all the possible solutions and not just one and thus it is not worthwhile to rush down to the leaves.\n",

Changing your mind is equivalent to sending an item back (obviously in a real application you do not send an item back and forth, you already know the solution and simply do not send the item). So, whenever we insert a value in the flow matrix, e.g. from vertex i to j, we insert at the same time an equivalent negative flow from j to i. This negative flow is not real, also because from j to i there might not be a connection, but having a negative flow there automatically lets the algorithm change its mind.\n",

    "Another little tweak that you need to make is allowing for paths to go back. Thus <b>only for calculating the paths</b> you need to use a symmetric adjacency matrix, i.e. whenever the value at place i,j is larger than 0 set also the corresponding value at j,i larger than 0 (in case it is not). Beware that this matrix must be used only for finding paths, for the rest of the algorithm use the adjacency matrix of the original input."
